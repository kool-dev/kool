### Laravel example

First of all you will need to cd into your application's directory and run:

```bash
$ kool preset laravel
```

This will create the files you need to configure your services. Feel free to edit **docker-compose.yml** to add or remove services as needed.

Then we will go ahead and run:

```bash
$ kool start
```

Then when you're done for the day:

```bash
$ kool stop
```

Check your **kool.yml** to see what scripts you can run and add more.
