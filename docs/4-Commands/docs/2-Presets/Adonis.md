### Create Adonis Project from Scratch

To make things easier we will use **kool** to install it for you.

```bash
kool create adonis my-project

cd my-project
```
- **kool create** already executes **kool preset** internally so you can skip the command in the next step

Or

```bash
kool docker kooldev/node:14-adonis adonis new my-project

cd my-project
```

### Start using kool

Go to the project folder and run:

```bash
$ kool preset adonis
```

**kool preset** basically creates a few configuration files in order to enable you to configure / extend it. You don't need to execute it whether you chose kool create command to start the new project.

By default adonis preset comes with **mysql** and **redis** pre-configured, to enable you can uncomment it at **docker-compose.yml** file.

Also comes with some scripts to bring you up to speed at **kool.yaml**, take a look at the defaults.

By default we always add a script called **setup** to help you setup a project for first time, but adonis also requires some environment changes in order to work with **docker**, bellow are the following changes.

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=3333
APP_URL=http://localhost:${PORT}
```

If you use something like **mysql**:

```bash
DB_USERNAME=user
DB_PASSWORD=pass
DB_HOST=database
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=database
```

The host you will use in your application config for any service using docker like mysql, redis or mongo will be the service name in the **docker-compose.yml**, so **mysql** will be referenced as **database**, feel free to change the name.

We recommend making these changes to you **.env.example** file to avoid steps on future installations.

```bash
$ kool run setup
```

Now you can see your site at **http://localhost:3333**.

Check your **kool.yml** to see what scripts you can run and add more.
