From **development** to **production**, **kool** brings speed and security to software development teams using different stacks; making their development environments reproducible and easy to set up.

**kool** can help you:

* Stop installing lots of things on your machine like NGINX, PHP, NODE
* Stop writing documentation on how to set up local environments
* Eliminate "works on my machine" issues due to different version / setup
* Have total control of each stack per project. Different projects on different versions? No problem!
* Use the very same stack / version as your production environment
* Work the same way on different stacks / projects (Laravel? Adonis? NextJS? Symfony?)
