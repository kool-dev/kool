From **development** to **production**, kool brings speed and security to software development teams from different stacks, making their development environments reproducible and easy to set up.

Here are a few things kool can help you with:

* Stop installing lots of things on your machine like NGINX, PHP, NODE
* Stop writing documentation on how to setup local environments
* No more works on my machine due to different version / setup
* Have total control of the stack per project, different projects on different versions? No problem!
* Have the very same stack / version from your production environment
* Work the same way on different stacks / projects (laravel? adonis? nextjs? symfony?)
